# Optidash-Challenge-OCR-for-hand-written-digits
- An implementation of an OCR for hand-written text  
- The algorithm takes a single file as input (JPEG, PDF) and returns all hand-written text (mostly digits) found and recognized on that input. 

"Note: This is the edits from the branch DV by dv-123 for the Optidash buddy Challange. Main goal for this challange is to make a Digit Recogonizer and I will be following the approach of using CNN and MLP model with some hyperparameter tunings to train the classifier. Training dataset for this part will be the MNIST dataset from the kaggle Digit Recogonizer Challange."
